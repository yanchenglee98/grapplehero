## Motivation

The current pandemic probably has most of us rolling around in **boredom** every day, constantly trying to maintain our sanity and keep our minds occupied. Even we are! Hence we would like to embrace this opportunity to create a super exciting game to provide **nostalgic entertainment** and help **cure your quarantine boredom!**

Our generation grew up playing famous 2D platformers such as Super Mario Bros and we would like to try our hands on making our very own, to help people **relive their childhood**. Furthermore, we decided to put a twist on the classic 2D platformer recipe by including **grappling hooks** which is a feature that is missing on other popular 2D platformers! With limitless possibilities to utilize this amazing tool, you can even **swing** around islands and achieve your lifelong dream of being Spiderman/Tarzan! As for fans of action-adventure games like tomb raider, our game will undoubtedly satisfy your **adventuring** needs! 

Currently, Grapple Hero will be **developed on PC** since the grappling hook might require more precision which is more suited to a mouse. If time allows, we might port it to Android to allow users to enjoy the game on their phones, allowing them to **kill time** during their daily commutes once the circuit breaker/quarantine is over.


## Aim

We want to make a simple yet engaging tomb raider style **2D platformer PC game**. It will be based around **exploration** with lots of **grappling hook action** with collectibles and awesome boss fights not found in any other 2D platformers.

Our target demographic would be the **generation Z young adults**, especially NUS students who have also played famous 2D platformers when they were young. The pixel art style is **reminiscent** of their favourite childhood games and the basic yet unique control scheme of Grapple Hero will surely make them feel at home! Players will be able to roam around freely and use their grappling hook to reach greater heights.

## User Stories
